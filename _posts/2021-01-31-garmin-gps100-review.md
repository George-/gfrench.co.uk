title: "30 years of Garmin - A review of the GPS100 in 2021"

I recently purchased a Garmin GPS100 AVD, this is the first product Garmin (previously ProNav) launched in 1991 for roughly $2500 new, this one cost me just £100 second hand on eBay in 2021. You may wonder why I purchased such an old piece of kit when we have so many modern navigation tools at our disposal today, but the aircraft I currently fly from Old Buckenham airfield, a 1967 Piper Cherokee 140, still has one of these GPS100 units panel-mounted in the cockpit and until now I’ve never used it or had much reason to.

In lockdown I’ve taken this opportunity to try and learn how this GPS unit works inside out while I’m firmly planted on the ground, this is more economical than trying to learn how to use a product up in the air considering this was the first of it’s kind, and it was not necessarily putting its user interface at the top of the priority list, but to Garmin’s credit, they had nothing to benchmark this product against, it was the very first consumer GPS designed for pilots, up until then GPS was rather exclusively used by the military.

I’ve never truly understood how to use the GPS100 in our group aircraft because at first glance it looks complicated, and I already make use of an iPad recently paired with a uAvonix SkyEcho2 courtesy of the CAA’s electronic conspicuity bursary scheme. On top of this I have peace of mind in a 1:500,000 chart, and the majority of the time my head is outside the cockpit anyway. However, I won’t turn down another backup solution, which is where the panel-mounted GPS100 in my groups' aircraft comes into the spotlight.

Providing the GPS100 with an initial date, time and position after turning it on, it took some time to get a satellite fix requiring a minimum of 3 satellites for a 2D fix or 4 satellites for a 3D fix, anything more just provides accuracy. Surprisingly my unit still got a fix while inside on the windowsill, although it was not a very good one (no external antenna used) I’m not that bothered because it has an inbuilt simulator function which is exactly what I’m after to learn and experiment with the various features. I should note I had to replace the internal battery so it remembers these settings each time it’s turned on, but that was a 5-minute job costing me only £1.62 for the CR2430 lithium battery so no complaints there. I’ve also noticed the ‘auto magnetic variation’ function seems to be a few degrees out, I have a feeling that being 30 years old the units database hasn’t factored the annual change in magnetic variation in 2021…

The GPS100 is also able to provide a data output that can interface with an auto-pilot system or a panel-mounted CDI to reflect the active navigation route, although this is not something we have in our aircraft I still think it would've been an impressive feature at the time this was originally launched.

In the 1990s Garmin would have released database updates for these to keep navigation waypoints and things such as annual magnetic variation change up-to-date, but that all stopped a very long time ago, so instead I’ve been manually storing waypoints using the latitude and longitude for a route I’m hoping to fly once lockdown restrictions allow. I can then use the Garmin direct-to feature or build up a flight plan and activate it. Once I input a simulated groundspeed the CDI indicates the course I’d need to steer to maintain track, it’s a simple display but it still tells me everything I need to know at the heart of it. The menu structure itself is practical and feels familiar like any other Garmin nav, although compared to a newer GPS175 with a touchscreen the GPS100 requires some patience. Nowadays Garmin and other manufacturers aviation GPS products can be IFR certified by an aviation authority to provide RNP (previously RNAV) IFR approaches, the first product to do this was the GPS 155 TSO which followed on shortly after the GPS100.


The GPS100 helped changed the way people navigate, it’s still possible to find articles online from the 1990s that question whether GPS is going to be “the future”… which is why I thought I’d put this write-up together to acknowledge how far we’ve come in three decades. In the 21st century, we have highly accurate GPS enabled moving maps with pilots following their magenta lines, coupled with ADSB electronic conspicuity devices, and nearly every phone having GPS if those other tools fail. GPS is a common commodity if the GNSS coverage is available, hopefully, the UK will continue to have access to the EU’s Galileo system after Brexit to guarantee our aviation sectors utilisation of GNSS, especially in ILS approaches, CAA PAPER 2003/9 is worth a read on this topic. It’s good to know how this technology at our disposal can be used to the best of its ability, and it can certainly help us to build up better situational awareness. I’m looking forward to my next flight to try and use this GPS100 as a backup to a backup, at least now I know what it can do.
